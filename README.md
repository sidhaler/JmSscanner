# JmSscaner 
****


# LINUX (Ubuntu) :
****
I don't know how scanner is doing on other distros. 

EXAMPLES:
```
./jmsrequest *ur target* [OPTIONS]

./jmsrequest 192.168.1.1 -p 1000
```



# Windows(its retarded don't ever use this version) :
****

The windows version is too bugged for normal use. I will try to rewrite whole project into c# but in long future.

`` jmsrequest.exe *ur_target* *max_port_range* ``
